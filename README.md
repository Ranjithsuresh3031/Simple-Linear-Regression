Project Title: Simple Linear Regression on Diamonds Dataset

Description:
Conducted a focused analysis of the Diamonds dataset using Seaborn and StatsModels in Python. Explored the relationship between the carat weight of diamonds and their prices through data visualization and simple linear regression.

Key Contributions:

    Utilized Seaborn for data visualization, creating a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between carat and price.
    Applied simple linear regression to model the linear relationship between carat weight and diamond prices.
    Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
    Conducted model evaluation using statistical metrics such as Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Squared Error.
    Created a visualization to compare actual diamond prices with model-predicted prices.

Outcome:
Developed a simple linear regression model that accurately predicts diamond prices based on carat weight. This project demonstrates proficiency in data analysis, statistical modeling, and data visualization, showcasing the ability to extract valuable insights from data.
